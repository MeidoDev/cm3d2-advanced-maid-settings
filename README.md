Advanced Maid Settings (v2.2)
=============

This package is a combination of multiple plugins and patches that enable an advanced customization of your maids beyond of what the game originally offers. **In order to be able to use it, you will need a correctly set up ReiPatcher and UnityInjector environment. Also, your game version needs to be 1.15 or newer!**

The following mods are included:

### Installation

* Download the source archive and extract it into a directory of your liking (but not the ReiPatcher or CM3D2 folder), while keeping the directory structure intact.


* Edit the "Setup" section of `build.bat` so that the paths match your installation. Note: The script assumes that your ReiPatcher patches are stored in a subfolder called `Patches` inside your ReiPatcher folder. If you changed that for some reason, make sure to edit the rest of the file accordingly.


* Run `build.bat`. If everything worked, all the necessary file have been created / copied into the correct places so you just have to run ReiPatcher now and you're done.


### Usage


* While in the maid edit screen, press `F5` to open the customization panel.


* If your maid has MaidVoicePitch configuration data stored in her free comment, you can load it by pressing `F4`.


* Please note that extended slider ranges (i.e. for body size) won't work until you activate the "Unlock sliders" / `WIDESLIDER` option.


* Customization data is no longer stored in the free comment, but in a special XML file when you save the game. For example, if you customized your maid and saved the game into slot 2 (`SaveData002.save`), the information will be saved into `SaveData002.save.exsave.xml`. It is also possible to manually edit these files and then load to game to adjust maid settings.


* If you do not want regular sliders having extended value ranges, delete the file `MaidVoicePitchSlider.xml` in the `UnityInjector\Config` folder, or change the values specified in that file accordingly.
